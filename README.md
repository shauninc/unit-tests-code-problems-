# Unit Tests with Jest 

This repository contains a bunch javascript functions and Jest unit test for each. 

## How to run the tests

1. Before you can run the tests, you need to have Node and NPM installed.  You can install node using the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/), or (*mac only*) by first installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and running `brew install node`.
2. Now you have node, you can install the dependencies this project needs to run. Make sure you have `cd`'d into this project, and then run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in package.json.
3. Finally, you're ready to run the tests! Run `npm run test` to run the full test suite.
